title: Chesapeake Global Collaboratory Framing Workshop
abstract: >-
  The University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES) is
  launching the Chesapeake Global Collaboratory as a new institution-wide
  initiative that will focus on developing solutions to the major environmental
  challenges facing the region, nation and planet. Our thesis is that solutions
  to these complex socio-environmental problems require bringing new partners,
  new voices and new tools together to create transformative solutions.


  We are inviting select external and internal thought leaders together for a one-day workshop in Solomons, Maryland, to identify how the Chesapeake Global Collaboratory model can be used to lead us to a more sustainable and resilient future.


  We have identified some broad categories of complex socio-environmental problems that will form the basis of our discussions at the workshop: coastal resilience, the urban ocean, human and environmental health, sustainable agriculture, and environmental justice. The goal of the workshop is to identify the critical new partners, new community voices and new analytical and visualization tools that will be needed to make progress on each of these issues. The suite of actors and tools identified will then be a focus of a more detailed, multiday environmental summit in September 2023 that will formally launch the Chesapeake Global Collaboratory. These efforts are made possible through generous support from the Merrill Family Foundation.
